Elon Reeve Musk FRS (/ˈiːlɒn/ EE-lon; born June 28, 1971) is a business magnate and investor. He is the founder, CEO, and Chief Engineer at SpaceX; angel investor, CEO, and Product Architect of Tesla, Inc.; founder of The Boring Company; and co-founder of Neuralink and OpenAI. With an estimated net worth of around US$242 billion as of July 25, 2022,[5] Musk is the wealthiest person in the world according to both the Bloomberg Billionaires Index and Forbes' real-time billionaires list.[6][7]

Musk was born in Pretoria, South Africa, where he grew up. He briefly attended the University of Pretoria before moving to Canada at age 17, acquiring citizenship through his Canadian-born mother. Two years later, he matriculated at Queen's University and transferred to the University of Pennsylvania, where he received bachelor's degrees in Economics and Physics. He moved to California in 1995 to attend Stanford University but decided instead to pursue a business career, co-founding the web software company Zip2 with his brother Kimbal. The startup was acquired by Compaq for $307 million in 1999. The same year, Musk co-founded online bank X.com, which merged with Confinity in 2000 to form PayPal. eBay bought PayPal in 2002, for $1.5 billion.

In 2002, Musk founded SpaceX, an aerospace manufacturer and space transport services company, of which he serves as CEO and Chief Engineer. In 2004, he was an early investor in electric vehicle manufacturer Tesla Motors, Inc. (now Tesla, Inc.). He became its chairman and product architect, eventually assuming the position of CEO in 2008. In 2006, he helped create SolarCity, a solar energy company that was later acquired by Tesla and became Tesla Energy. In 2015, he co-founded OpenAI, a nonprofit research company promoting friendly artificial intelligence (AI). In 2016, he co-founded Neuralink, a neurotechnology company focused on developing brain–computer interfaces, and founded The Boring Company, a tunnel construction company. He agreed to purchase the major American social networking service Twitter in 2022, for $44 billion, but later stated he was terminating the deal; he is currently involved in a legal battle with Twitter which intends to complete the transaction. Musk has proposed a hyperloop high-speed vactrain transportation system and is the president of the Musk Foundation, which donates to scientific research and education.

Musk has been criticized for making unscientific and controversial statements, such as spreading misinformation about the COVID-19 pandemic. In 2018, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) sued Musk for falsely tweeting that he had secured funding for a private takeover of Tesla; he settled with the SEC but did not admit guilt, and he temporarily stepped down from his Tesla chairmanship. In 2019, he won a defamation case brought against him by a British caver who had advised in the Tham Luang cave rescue. 

Elon Reeve Musk was born on June 28, 1971, in Pretoria, one of the capital cities of apartheid South Africa.[8][9] His mother is Maye Musk (née Haldeman), a model and dietitian born in Saskatchewan, Canada, but raised in South Africa.[10][11][12] His father is Errol Musk, a South African electromechanical engineer, pilot, sailor, consultant, and property developer who was a half-owner of a Zambian emerald mine near Lake Tanganyika.[13][14] Musk has a younger brother, Kimbal (born 1972), and a younger sister, Tosca (born 1974).[12][15] His maternal grandfather, Joshua Haldeman, was an adventurous American-born Canadian who took his family on record-breaking journeys in a single-engine Bellanca airplane to Africa and Australia.[16][17][18] Musk has British and Pennsylvania Dutch ancestry.[19][20]

Musk's family was wealthy during his youth. His father was elected to the Pretoria City Council as a representative of the anti-apartheid Progressive Party, with the Musk children reportedly sharing their father's dislike of apartheid.[8][b] After his parents divorced in 1980, Musk mostly lived with his father,[19] a choice he made two years after the divorce and subsequently regretted.[21] Musk has become estranged from his father.[21] He has a paternal half-sister and a half-brother.[16][22]

As a child Musk's adenoids were removed because doctors suspected he was deaf, but his mother later decided that he was just thinking "in another world".[23] Aged 10, Musk developed an interest in computing and video games and acquired a Commodore VIC-20.[24] He learned computer programming using a manual and, at age 12, sold the code of a BASIC-based video game he created called Blastar to PC and Office Technology magazine for approximately $500.[25][26] In his biography, Ashlee Vance described Elon as an awkward and introverted child.[27] He attended Waterkloof House Preparatory School and Bryanston High School before graduating from Pretoria Boys High School.[28]

Aware it would be easier to enter the United States from Canada,[29] Musk applied for a Canadian passport through his Canadian-born mother.[30][31] While awaiting the documentation, he attended the University of Pretoria for five months; this allowed him to avoid mandatory service in the South African military.[32] Musk arrived in Canada in June 1989 and lived with a second cousin in Saskatchewan for a year,[33] working odd jobs at a farm and lumber-mill.[34] In 1990, he entered Queen's University in Kingston, Ontario.[35][36] Two years later, he transferred to the University of Pennsylvania, where he completed studies for a Bachelor of Arts degree in physics and a Bachelor of Science degree in economics from the Wharton School in 1995.[37][38]

In 1994, Musk held two internships in Silicon Valley during the summer: at energy storage startup Pinnacle Research Institute, which investigated electrolytic ultracapacitors for energy storage, and at the Palo Alto-based startup Rocket Science Games.[39] In 1995, he was accepted to a Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) program in materials science at Stanford University in California.[40] Musk tried to get a job at Netscape but never received a response to his inquiries.[30] He dropped out of Stanford after two days, deciding instead to join the Internet boom and launch a startup.[41]

In 1995, Musk, his brother Kimbal, and Greg Kouri founded web software company Zip2 with funds borrowed from Musk's father.[42][21] They housed the venture at a small rented office in Palo Alto.[43] The company developed and marketed an Internet city guide for the newspaper publishing industry, with maps, directions, and yellow pages.[44] Musk says that before the company became successful, he could not afford an apartment and instead rented an office; he slept on the couch, showered at the YMCA, and shared one computer with his brother.[45]

According to Musk, "The website was up during the day and I was coding it at night, seven days a week, all the time."[43] The Musk brothers obtained contracts with The New York Times and the Chicago Tribune,[46] and persuaded the board of directors to abandon plans for a merger with CitySearch.[47] Musk's attempts to become CEO were thwarted by the board.[48] Compaq acquired Zip2 for $307 million in cash in February 1999,[49][50] and Musk received $22 million for his 7-percent share.[51]
